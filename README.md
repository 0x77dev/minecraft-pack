# Minecraft Pack
[![Server Docker Publish](https://github.com/0x77dev/minecraft-pack/actions/workflows/docker-publish.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/0x77dev/minecraft-pack/actions/workflows/docker-publish.yml)

**!!AHTUNG, offensive language!!**

Proof of concept of running minecraft server without tunnels, port forwarding, absolutely free on Heroku, transferring data over WebSocket using custom launcher and WS<->TCP bridge and world snapshoting to free firebase Google Cloud Storage.

My personal minecraft server pack, built on top of [itzg/minecraft-server](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server), with WebSocket proxy and custom launcher.
